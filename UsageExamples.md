# Usage Examples

## Example 1: Merging Files
Use the `FileMerger` class to merge multiple files into a single output file.

```typescript
// Example usage of FileMerger
const merger = new FileMerger();
merger.merge(['file1.txt', 'file2.txt'], 'output.txt');
```

## Example 2: Azure Integration
Leverage the `AzureIntegration` class to deploy merged files to Azure Blob Storage.

```typescript
// Example usage of AzureIntegration
const azure = new AzureIntegration();
azure.uploadToBlob('output.txt', 'my-container');
```

# Best Practices for Protecting Sensitive Data

1. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest and TLS for data in transit).

2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and secrets in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your application.

3. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.

4. **Secure Storage**: Use secure storage solutions like Azure Key Vault to manage and access secrets, keys, and certificates.

5. **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive data in logs, error messages, or when displaying it in the UI to prevent accidental exposure.

6. **Audit and Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activities involving sensitive data.

7. **Regular Updates**: Keep your dependencies, libraries, and frameworks up-to-date to avoid vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive data.

8. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks that could compromise sensitive data.

9. **Backup and Recovery**: Ensure sensitive data is backed up securely and have a recovery plan in place.

10. **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) to ensure sensitive data is handled appropriately.
